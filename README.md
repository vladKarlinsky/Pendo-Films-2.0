## If I had the time, what would I change?

:ballot_box_with_check:Implement a more cost effective keyword suggestion search (regading fetching).    
:ballot_box_with_check:Implement a smarter keyword suggestion search, which can adapt to different API response edge cases - currently, this may result in empty screens after the search term has been submitted.    
:ballot_box_with_check:To be compliant with android development best practices, I wouldâ€™ve updated the current navigation system to fragments (Jetpack Navigation component).  
:ballot_box_with_check:A bit more code refactoring.
